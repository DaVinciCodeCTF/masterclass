# Linux

- created in 1991 by Linus Torvalds
- GNU/Linux: most used operating system on servers
- Open source

# Bash

- Born Again SHell
- interpreter
- textual interface with your computer

# Getting the context

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Where am I?
pwd
```

# Getting the context
```{bash eval=FALSE}
# Who am i?
id
whoami
```

# Getting the context
```{bash eval=FALSE}
# What's in my directory?
ls
```

# Getting the context
```{bash eval=FALSE}
# What am I connected to?
uname -a
```

# Getting the context

```{bash eval=FALSE}
# What am I connected to?
ip a
```

# Read the f(ancy|ucking) manual

Almost all commands display help when you type:

```{bash eval=FALSE}
man bash
# or
bash --help
```

# Moving around directories

```{bash eval=FALSE}
cd /home/joytide # Change Directory
cat, xxd, head, tail, diff, less
mkdir
touch, rm
cp
mv
nano, vim
```

# Ownership and permissions

Use the **sudo** prefix to execute the command as the superuser (admin).

```{bash eval=FALSE}
sudo
chmod
chown
```

# Finding files

```{bash eval=FALSE}
find
locate
which
grep # Find inside a file
```

# Piping

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', out.width = "50%"}
include_graphics("images/piping.jpg")
```

You can pipe commands together and use the output of a command into another command:
```{bash eval=FALSE}
grep -v '#' main.py | wc -l
```

# Stream redirection

- two primary streams: stdin (input) and stdout (output)
```{bash eval=FALSE}
echo 'hello' > summary.txt
base64 -w 0 < summary.txt > summary.txt.b64
```

# Installing programs (Debian/Ubuntu)

```{bash eval=FALSE}
apt update # download packages information
apt install vim
```

# Compressing and archiving

```{bash eval=FALSE}
tar xvf archive.tar.gz
gzip -d archive.gz
unzip archive.zip
```

# Never forgetti

If you forget a command that you already typed, check your history!

```{bash eval=FALSE}
history
history | grep 'ssh'
```

You can also use Ctrl+R to search in your history directly from the command line.

# Networking

```{bash eval=FALSE}
ping # send ICMP requests
nc # raw TCP sessions
ssh # Secure SHell
curl # send HTTP requests
wget # send HTTP requests
traceroute # see the route of a TCP packet to a given host
nslookup # send DNS requests
dig # send DNS requests
```

# Processes

```{bash eval=FALSE}
ps # list all processes
pstree # list all processes with parents/children
systemctl # service manager
```

# Bash scripting

```{bash eval=FALSE}
for offset in {1..100}
do
	curl http://images.amazing.school/?image=$offset
done
```

# Linux

- **EVERYTHING** is a file
  - e.g. keyboard events are accessible @ `/dev/input/event0`, the brightness of your screen @ `/sys/class/backlight`
- a file is a collection of data stored in one unit
